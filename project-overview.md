**Working Title:** 
# Designing data explorations for visitor engagement and sustainable practices with community gardens.  

## RQ1
How might one design a tool or a collection of tools that supports situated digital data collection in an urban farm or community space? 

## RQ2
How successful are the interventions in fostering visitor enagement, raising local awareness of sustainable development goals and increasing visitor numbers?  

## The problem space (e.g. what are you trying to do and why and how):
The product of the work will be: 
* to create a **physical object or artefact** that will present data from visitor satisfaction and or demographic data to make data collection and use more open, promote discussion and engage locals and visitors;
* to make visitor data quantifiable, accessible and persistent by redesigning the QMUL survey for the web. This will mean that future reporting and data interrogation can be carried out easily; 
* to report findings relating to response rates for surveys where no visualisation is provided compared with response rates where survey data is presented to the user through either physical or digital means. This is to understand if there is a link between visibility of data use and trust or perceived value contribution; 
* to digitise and report on response data for surveys up to and including the project so that SCF can access and make use of historical data.
