title: Thinking about modes and methods
---

Take part and contribute to art:
* Create a bug hotel sculpture. Select pieces of wood whose rings correspond to visitor ages and build up the bug hotel when participants have responded to the survey
* Choose survey: QMUL or other metrics?
* Use 3d printing or laser cutting to build a frame
* Create a page on the SCF website that includes a digital version of the survey 
* Speak to City student surveys team about paper forms and electronic data validation
* Think about if I want to do postal votes to send to volunteers
* Colour code the wood discs according to tourist / local / volunteer or mode of travel/transport or motivation for visiting work/play?
